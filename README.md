# Real-Time-Object-Detection-in-Low-Light-Fog
A real-time object detection system optimized for low-light and foggy conditions using YOLOv5/YOLOv8.


## Objective
- Detect objects accurately under low-light and foggy conditions.
- Compare performance against standard lighting scenarios.
- Ensure real-time processing with high FPS.

## Approach
- **Models Used:** YOLOv5, YOLOv8
- **Preprocessing:** Histogram equalization, dehazing, contrast enhancement.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Trained on a custom dataset with foggy and low-light images.
